# Strategy to OKR translation guide

## Inputs
- Strategy pillars (3-5)
- Business targets and constraints
- Known risks and dependencies

## Method
1. Convert each pillar into 1 outcome statement
2. Create 2-3 measurable key results per outcome
3. Identify initiatives that move the key results
4. Confirm owners and measurement cadence

## Quality checks
- Key results are measurable and time-bound
- Initiatives have a clear tie to a key result
- Avoid "activity" key results
