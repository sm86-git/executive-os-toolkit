# Weekly Exec Staff facilitation guide

## Before the meeting
- Ensure the pre-read is complete and crisp
- Identify decisions that need a call and timebox them
- Pre-wire contentious topics 1:1 if needed

## During the meeting
- Keep discussion anchored to the decision or ask
- If debate repeats, summarize options and force a call
- Write outputs live: decisions, actions, escalations, comms

## After the meeting (within 2 hours)
- Publish the action list and decision log updates
- Send follow-ups to owners with due dates
- Flag anything that needs a broader org update

## Common failure modes
- Too many updates, not enough decisions
- Owners unclear
- Actions without deadlines
- Risks discussed without an exec ask
