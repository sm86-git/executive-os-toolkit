# Decision log template

Maintain one decision log for the leadership team.

| Date | Decision | Decision maker | Owner | Rationale | Status | Link to brief |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  | Proposed / Approved / Reversed |  |

Tips:
- Write the decision as a clear statement, not a topic
- Capture rationale in 1-2 sentences
- If reversed, record why and what changed
