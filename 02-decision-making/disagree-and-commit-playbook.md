# Disagree and commit playbook

## When to use
- After a decision has been made by the right decision maker
- When additional debate is not worth the delay

## How to say it
1. State your concern in one sentence
2. Confirm you understand the rationale
3. Commit to execution and clarify your role
4. Agree on what signal would trigger a revisit

## Guardrails
- Do not use it to silence essential risk concerns
- Record dissent and rationale in the decision log
- Set a review date if uncertainty is high
