# DACI / RAPID cheat sheet

Use one model consistently.

## DACI
- Driver: runs the process
- Approver: makes the decision
- Contributors: provide input
- Informed: notified after the decision

## RAPID
- Recommend: proposes a course of action
- Agree: must agree before decision is final
- Perform: executes the decision
- Input: consulted for data and perspective
- Decide: makes the decision

Rule of thumb:
- If decisions stall, clarify who "Decides" or who "Approves" in writing.
