# Meeting hygiene

## Default rules
- Pre-read over live slides
- Start and end on time
- No status reads. Use time for decisions and blockers.

## Attendance
- Invite the smallest group that can decide
- If someone is only "FYI", send notes instead

## Timeboxing
- Assign a facilitator and a timekeeper
- Park unrelated topics in a parking lot

## Output
- Decisions, actions, and owners must be written before the meeting ends
