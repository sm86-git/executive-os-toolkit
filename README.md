# Executive Operating System Toolkit

A practical, reusable "exec operating system" you can drop into a leadership team to drive clarity, decisions, and execution.
It is designed for Chiefs of Staff, PMO leaders, and operators supporting executive teams.

Everything here is vendor-neutral and uses plain templates you can run in Google Docs, Notion, Confluence, or Markdown.

## Quick start (30 minutes)

1. Start a **Decision Log**
   - Use: [`/02-decision-making/decision-log-template.md`](./02-decision-making/decision-log-template.md)

2. Launch a **Weekly Exec Staff** cadence
   - Agenda: [`/01-cadence/weekly-exec-staff/agenda-template.md`](./01-cadence/weekly-exec-staff/agenda-template.md)
   - Pre-read: [`/01-cadence/weekly-exec-staff/pre-read-template.md`](./01-cadence/weekly-exec-staff/pre-read-template.md)
   - Outputs checklist: [`/01-cadence/weekly-exec-staff/outputs-checklist.md`](./01-cadence/weekly-exec-staff/outputs-checklist.md)

3. Standardize status
   - Status template: [`/03-execution-and-visibility/status/status-update-template.md`](./03-execution-and-visibility/status/status-update-template.md)
   - Health definitions: [`/03-execution-and-visibility/status/health-definitions.md`](./03-execution-and-visibility/status/health-definitions.md)
