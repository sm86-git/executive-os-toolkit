# Operating principles

These principles keep the system effective and lightweight.

1. Clarity beats activity
   - If the team cannot explain priorities in one page, the system is too noisy.

2. Decisions are a product
   - A decision should have an owner, a date, and an artifact.

3. One source of truth
   - Avoid parallel versions across email, chat, and slides.

4. Escalation is a service
   - The goal is to surface issues early with options, not surprises.

5. Make tradeoffs explicit
   - Every "yes" implies a "not now" for something else.

6. Use definitions, not vibes
   - Health, risk, and confidence must be defined.
